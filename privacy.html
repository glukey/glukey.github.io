			<h2>The Detailed Version</h2>
			<p>
	      James Pierce built the Glukey app as
	      an Open Source app. This SOFTWARE is provided by
	      at no cost and is intended for use as is.

        If you choose to use the Software, then you agree
        to this policy. GluKey will not use or share your

      </p>

			<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
			<p>

				from Dexcom servers.
      </p>
			<p>
        The app does NOT use third party services that could collect
        information used to identify you.

        GluKey values your trust. We only store your Dexcom credentials
				locally and encrypted in the macOS keychain. Data from Dexcom is
				sent and received via an encrypted connection. However, remember
        that no method of transmission over the internet, or method
        of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and
        GluKey cannot guarantee its absolute security.
